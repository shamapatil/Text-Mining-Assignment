['\nAs usual great & premium phone of 2020 .ProsThis time the Apple iPhone 12 uses the right-angled bezel of the iPhone 4S, which looks square, and it feels good in the hand. It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow. I give this smartphone a pass mark in every other aspect save the battery, that is a huge minus. From an Android fanboy point of view, the iPhone 12 battery is at best, laughable.\n', "\nBeen using iphone12pro since January & I love it. Many used to tell me that buying 12 pros online isn't safe.

One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp. Only issue is it does not have a higher refresh rate but you won't feel that in a tiny bit!! Go for it!!So far the the battery is just ok I really expected longer life. So far so good!!\n", '\nI have Prebooked this iPhone12 pro and received this item on time.So after 1 month of usage I am writing the Review of this iPhone. This iPhone 12pro Is the best in all the things of mobile.The Camera Quality of This iPhone is the best in every aspects.It gives clear and stunning details of Everything of which we r taking a pic Especially in Night Mode. In Night Mode there is correct balance of light of a pic.This iPhone12pro can handle multiple tasks at a single time without giving the problem of hanging.The Finish from outside and also gripping in our hands is perfect.The Lidar Sensor is best as it can measure the height and width of man,electronic appliances, etc.This iPhone12pro has beated the DSLR Camera in all matters.The Video Quality of iPhone12pro is Awesome. The video is so smooth with correct audio.When we buy iPhone no one can move to buy smartphone,as iPhone is best in all things we need in this modern world of technology and health.\n', "\nExcellent Phone and equally superb service from Amazon. I ordered the phone on 20th June at night (11:50) and I received the phone on 21st June morning (9:25) - brilliant service from Amazon.Super good camera. Portrait mode - splendid, as buttery as ever. 6GB RAM is super good you'll never feel a lag ... even after heavy usage battery stays for whole day - with heavy usage on online surfing, tele-calling, clicking photos and videos. Especially there is no phone in market clicking for better video shots. Graphite colour is lovely with glossy sides. Stunning look.Awesome experience using dark mode ... Excellent.Apple eco-system is as good as ever. makes life so easy and seamless. highly recommend to buy iPhone through Amazon.\n", '\nAs usual great & premium phone of 2020 .ProsThis time the Apple iPhone 12 uses the right-angled bezel of the iPhone 4S, which looks square, and it feels good in the hand. It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow. I give this smartphone a pass mark in every other aspect save the battery, that is a huge minus. From an Android fanboy point of view, the iPhone 12 battery is at best, laughable.\n', "\nBeen using iphone12pro since January & I love it. Many used to tell me that buying 12 pros online isn't safe.

But I received a genuine product  .Regarding the phone , i think i need not explain much here ,  since there is enough youtube videos on detailed review . But overall , its good phone and worth the price .Only cons that I could see after using it for a weeks is that the batter will only last for a day with good screen time ( like watching videos and spending good time in social media ) . But this is more than enough for average users  .Since I was moving from Android , I had some issue in data/chat  Sync . But you can go through youtube for getting all workaround for your issues .\n', '\nexcellent cell\n', '\nI feel proud to be an iPhone user for past 10 years. Moving from i7 to i12Pro was a big jump and Apple has proved again with its high performance chip and pro cams.Instead of buy cheap Android phones every 2 or 3 years I feel it’s better to invest on iPhones.In my experience with iPhones 5, 7 & now 12Pro maintenance on phone is very important. Make sure you handle the phone with care and do not drop it often. Minimum 5 years one iPhone will last with out any issues.I was a great fan of Symbian OS in my 20’s I would say IOS the best compared to Android.Just go for it!!!\n', '\nRecently shifted from an iPhone 6s (32GB) after 6 years to an iPhone 12 Pro (512GB). The phone is very good. Everything is working fine as excepted.Face unlock works like a charm although I miss the fingerprint sensor on 6s as we wear masks due to covid and need to enter passcode each time on 12 pro.  (Edit: Face unlock now works even with wearing the mask after the latest software update)I would recommend to get the maximum storage possible as 4K 60fps videos and RAW photos will consume ur storage like anything.

So there is an extra 12MP telephoto lens along with the 12MP wide and ultra wide cameras seen on the iPhone 12. Interestingly, the telephoto and the ultra wide cameras have not really changed from the iPhone 11 times. One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp. Only issue is it does not have a higher refresh rate but you won't feel that in a tiny bit!! Go for it!!So far the the battery is just ok I really expected longer life. So far so good!!\n", '\nI have Prebooked this iPhone12 pro and received this item on time.So after 1 month of usage I am writing the Review of this iPhone. This iPhone 12pro Is the best in all the things of mobile.The Camera Quality of This iPhone is the best in every aspects.It gives clear and stunning details of Everything of which we r taking a pic Especially in Night Mode. In Night Mode there is correct balance of light of a pic.This iPhone12pro can handle multiple tasks at a single time without giving the problem of hanging.The Finish from outside and also gripping in our hands is perfect.The Lidar Sensor is best as it can measure the height and width of man,electronic appliances, etc.This iPhone12pro has beated the DSLR Camera in all matters.The Video Quality of iPhone12pro is Awesome. The video is so smooth with correct audio.When we buy iPhone no one can move to buy smartphone,as iPhone is best in all things we need in this modern world of technology and health.\n', "\nExcellent Phone and equally superb service from Amazon. I ordered the phone on 20th June at night (11:50) and I received the phone on 21st June morning (9:25) - brilliant service from Amazon.Super good camera. Portrait mode - splendid, as buttery as ever. 6GB RAM is super good you'll never feel a lag ... even after heavy usage battery stays for whole day - with heavy usage on online surfing, tele-calling, clicking photos and videos. Especially there is no phone in market clicking for better video shots. Graphite colour is lovely with glossy sides. Stunning look.Awesome experience using dark mode ... Excellent.Apple eco-system is as good as ever. makes life so easy and seamless. highly recommend to buy iPhone through Amazon.\n", '\nAs usual great & premium phone of 2020 .ProsThis time the Apple iPhone 12 uses the right-angled bezel of the iPhone 4S, which looks square, and it feels good in the hand. It feels better than the sleek bezel of the iPhone X, especially the 7.4mm thickness with right angles. The border is particularly stylish.The camera is awesome! The night view mode turns on automatically, and the imaging effect is really good! Video stabilization is also good!!!!!!!!The filter mode is quite good. Many Android phones are still many miles away from these tones even though there are good imitations. Apple was able to improve its tones.Image quality is perfect and there is little or no noise even in a low-light environment .** Signal, nothing to say! It is much better in iPhone 12 Pro & Wifi also .ConsThere is a problem with the hand-handling of this phone. Oh yes, the iPhone 12 is light to handle, however, it is not easy to handle. The iPhone 12 comes with metal edges and there have been multiple complaints with respect to these edges. If you handle this phone for a long time, as your hand becomes a bit moist, the metal becomes slippery. To prevent your phone from falling to the ground, you will sub-consciously tighten your grip on the phone. Several reports have shown that tightening your grip on the iPhone 12 leaves you with a scar on your palm. This means that the iPhone 12 edges are perhaps too sharp. This is a major flaw in the design of this phone that will force users to stick with a phone case. Please note that users with thick skin like mine do not experience this problem.*** The iPhone 12 battery capacity and performance are lower than the previous generation.Final VerdictOverall, I think Apple fanboys will be very comfortable with this device. There is a very serious flaw with the design though. Apple may need to make those edges smoother in subsequent remakes. For now, stick with your phone case to avoid injuries. If your skin is pretty thick like mine, then you do not have a problem. We can safely say that the network and camera of the iPhone 12 are great. However, the battery!!!, battery!!!, battery!!!. There is nothing positive about the iPhone 12 battery. It is smaller than its predecessor in all ramifications. The charging capacity is also slow. I give this smartphone a pass mark in every other aspect save the battery, that is a huge minus. From an Android fanboy point of view, the iPhone 12 battery is at best, laughable.\n', "\nBeen using iphone12pro since January & I love it. Many used to tell me that buying 12 pros online isn't safe.
